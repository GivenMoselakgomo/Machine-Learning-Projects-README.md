📚 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!
This space is dedicated to showcasing the ML work I’ve done across various domains — from regression and classification to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Each project is built with a strong focus on:

Clean, real-world data preprocessing

Thoughtful feature engineering

Building and comparing multiple machine learning models

Performance evaluation using industry-standard metrics

Clear, reproducible workflows using Python & popular data science libraries
