👋 Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository!
This is a growing collection of real-world ML projects designed to explore, learn, and apply machine learning techniques.

📊 Each project walks through the full ML workflow — data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
🤖 You’ll find projects in regression, classification, clustering, and ensemble learning using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
✨ The goal is to create clean, reproducible, and educational notebooks that showcase practical machine learning skills.
