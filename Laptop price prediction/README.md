💻 Laptop Price Prediction — Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications. By analyzing features like RAM, CPU, storage, GPU type, and screen size, the model provides a data-driven estimate of a laptop’s market value.

🔍 What This Project Covers

Preprocessing a structured laptop dataset

Engineering useful features

Training a Random Forest regression model

Evaluating performance using RMSE

Testing how price changes when individual specs are adjusted

💡 Key Insight

The model doesn’t rely on any single spec—it evaluates the entire configuration.
Changing RAM from 16GB to 8GB, for example, doesn’t always affect price the same way; the impact depends on the overall hardware setup.

🎯 Why This Matters

This project shows how machine learning can support smarter pricing decisions.
The same approach could be adapted for other industries—like small car dealerships—to predict fair prices more consistently and transparently.

🧰 Tools Used

Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib
